<a id="how-parking-in-pittsburgh-works" class="anchor" href="#how-parking-in-pittsburgh-works" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How parking in Pittsburgh works</h3>

<ul>
<li>In the City of Pittsburgh, we no longer have parking meters</li>
<li>Instead we use these small kiosks that are on every block</li>
<li>When you park, you enter your licence plate and pay for some parking time at the kiosk</li>
<li>The parking attendents then can check your licence plate against the list of licence plates in the system that have paid</li>
<li>What's nice about this is that you can pay and move your car with out having to worry about getting a ticket at your new spot or overpaying at your old spot
Important: you can only park within about a mile of the kiosk you paid at</li>
<li>And now with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sharewire.gomobilepgh">Go Mobile PGH</a> you can pay on your phone with just the kiosk number</li>
<li>Unfortunately, <strong>kiosks near more desireable locations cost more.</strong>
</li>
<li>Theoretically, you could <strong>pay in a cheap section and park in a more expensive section</strong> so long as it is less than a mile away.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<code>park-opt</code> allows you to pay at the lowest costing kiosk, by giving you the kiosk number for the lowest costing kiosk</li>
<li>
<code>park-opt</code> uses your phone's location to find the kiosk with the lowest rate</li>
<li>
<code>park-opt</code> lets you input what time you are going to leave</li>
<li>
<code>park-opt</code> pays as you park, so you can leave at anytime and not wory about having paid for the next few hours</li>
<li>
<code>park-opt</code> changes which kiosk you pay at based on which is cheapest and available at the time</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<code>park-opt</code> changes which kiosk you pay at so that you never exceed the time limits for each kiosk</li>
</ul>

<a id="why-pittsburgh" class="anchor" href="#why-pittsburgh" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Pittsburgh?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pittsburgh has the parking system that allows for the creation of an app like this</li>
<li>No other city (to my knowlage) has a system like this</li>
<li>(Also I live in the Greater Pittsburgh Area, which makes it easier to test <g-emoji alias="laughing" fallback-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f606.png">😆</g-emoji>)</li>
