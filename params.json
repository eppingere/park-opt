Feel free to send suggestions.\r\n\r\n## How does this work?\r\n\r\n### How parking in Pittsburgh works\r\n\r\n* In the City of Pittsburgh, we no longer have parking meters.\r\n* Instead, we use these small kiosks that are on every block.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Kiosk Image](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/64/5d/dd/645ddd21c1317d398723bdbdb6fbc8ef.jpg \"Kiosk Image\")\r\n\r\n\r\n* When you park, you enter your licence plate and pay for some parking time at the kiosk.\r\n* The parking attendents then can check your licence plate against the list of licence plates in the system that have paid.\r\n* What's nice about this is that you can pay and move your car with out having to worry about getting a ticket at your new spot or overpaying at your old spot.\r\n  Important: you can only park within about a mile of the kiosk where you paid\r\n* Now with [Go Mobile PGH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sharewire.gomobilepgh), you can pay on your phone with just the kiosk number.\r\n* Unfortunately, **kiosks near more desireable locations cost more.**\r\n* Theoretically, you could **pay in a cheap section and park in a more expensive section** as long as it is less than a mile away.\r\n\r\n### How `park-opt` saves you money\r\n\r\n* `park-opt` allows you to pay at the lowest costing kiosk, by giving you the kiosk number for the lowest costing kiosk that is within range.\r\n* `park-opt` uses your phone's location to find the kiosk with the lowest rate less than a mile away.\r\n* `park-opt` lets you input what time you are going to leave.\r\n* `park-opt` pays as you park, so you can leave at anytime and not wory about having paid for the next few hours.\r\n* `park-opt` changes which kiosk you pay at based on which is cheapest and available at the time.\r\n\r\n### How `park-opt` lets you park for longer\r\n\r\n* `park-opt` changes which kiosk you pay at so that you never exceed the time limits for each kiosk.\r\n\r\n## How to Use `park-opt` \r\n\r\n**Using `park-opt` is quite simple**\r\n\r\nSimply open the app and hit `Park Now`, then enter the meter number displayed into the `Go Mobile PGH` app\r\n\r\n\r\n![UI Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eppingere/park-opt/master/img/UI-Image.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why Pittsburgh?\r\n\r\n* Pittsburgh has the parking system that allows for the creation of an app like this.\r\n* No other city (to my knowledge) has a system like this.\r\n* (Also I live in the Greater Pittsburgh Area, which makes it easier to test :laughing:)\r\n\r\n",
